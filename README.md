# ZeroDivisionError in Average Calculation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: a `ZeroDivisionError` that occurs when calculating the average of an empty list. The `bug.py` file contains the faulty code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version.

The bug arises from attempting to divide by zero when the input list is empty.  The solution adds a check for an empty list to prevent this error.
